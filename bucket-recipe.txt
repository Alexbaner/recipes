Get a bucker or a 5l plastic water container and a 1.5l or 2l water/soda bottle. 
If you are using a 5l container and not a bucket you would want to cut it in half and fill that remaining half with water.
Cut the bottom of the 2l plastic bottle and make a cap for it from aluminium foil in which you will poke holes so the smoke can go through.
Insert the 2l bottle into the bucker/ 5l container and submerge it underwater ( most of it should be underwater ). Put your chiba in the aluminium foil cap and light it while
withdrawing the bottle from the bucket, such as gravity will pull the smoke inside. Remove the cap and draw smoke while inserting the bottle back into the water so the smoke gets
pushed into your lungs.
